**Linux** is a family of [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source), [Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/unix)-like operating systems that are all based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/linus-torvalds) and was first released on September 17, 1991.

Since its release, the Linux kernel has been adopted by many operating system distributions (commonly called "distros") for a wide variety of applications, from web servers to mobile platforms. The most well-known pure Linux distro is Ubuntu. However, other well-known operating systems, such as Android and Chrome OS, are based on the Linux kernel &mdash; though with modifications that typically have them categorized outside of Linux distros in general.

Many Linux distros are developed with a specific use case in mind. Some examples include:

- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux): Intended for server management in large enterprise systems.
- [Network Security Toolkit](https://www.networksecuritytoolkit.org/): Intended as a live DVD/USB Flash Drive that provides tools for network diagnostics, security, and monitoring.
- [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/): A desktop OS focused on providing privacy and security.
- [HandyLinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HandyLinux): Was a desktop OS designed for accessibility and the ability to run on old hardware.
- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/): A Linux distro specifically for the low-cost line of Raspberry PI single-board computers.
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/): Used for digital forensics and penetration testing.
