**Webpack** is a free and open-source [JavaScript module](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/modules) that can also be applied to [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html) and [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css). Webpack can be run on the [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux), macOS, and Windows operating systems.

As a module bundler, Webpack can be used with `webpack.config.js` to generate dependency graphs and define rules for tasks performed on a site. It is primarily used by developers to load, transform, and package modules for in-browser use.

[Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/node-js) is needed to use Webpack. However, it is supported by all browsers that are ES5-compliant.
