In Codecademy Docs, **entries** are single [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown) files with content and examples that describe a topic, concept, or term.

Topics and concepts share a one-to-many relationship:

- A single topic entry (e.g., [JavaScript (JS)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript)) may contain multiple concept entries (e.g., [Arrays in JS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays)).
- A single concept entry may contain multiple term entries (e.g., [`.filter()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/filter) and [`.find()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/find) methods under JS arrays).
