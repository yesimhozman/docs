**Contributions** to Docs allow community members of all skill sets to not only reinforce what they've (perhaps already) learned, but also to hone their skills in version control with [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git), peer-to-peer collaboration on [GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/github), and writing content in [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/markdown). Contributors get to work with the content team that maintains Docs as their contributions go through the [review](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/docs-community/reviews) process.

There are two primary types of Docs contributions:

- Create new content or edit existing entries on the [Docs repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs) via [GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/github).
- Suggest new content, ideas, and fixes in [Discussions](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/discussions) or the [feedback form](https://codecademyready.typeform.com/to/hzVIWDgz?typeform-source=www.codecademy.com).

More information about contributing to Docs can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> **Note:** All must sign the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/Codecademy/docs) when contributing to Docs for the first time.
