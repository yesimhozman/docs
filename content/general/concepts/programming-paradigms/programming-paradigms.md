A **programming paradigm** is an approach to programming. Depending on the language, the preferred paradigm may differ. Some languages, such as [C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp) and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript), cover multiple paradigms.

Moving from low-level languages (e.g., [machine code](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/machine-code)) to high-level languages (e.g., [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python)), programming paradigms change.

Below are some of the existing paradigms:
