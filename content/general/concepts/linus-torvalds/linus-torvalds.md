**Linus Torvalds** (1969 - ) is a Finnish-American computer scientist, the creator of the operating system kernel [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux), and the distributed revision control system, [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git).

The Linux kernel is an [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source), [Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/unix)-inspired operating system kernel publicly released in Version 1.0 by Linus Torvalds in 1994. Today, the Linux operating system manages the hardware and resources of a large number of applications such as Android, Chrome OS, and many others.

Git was later created by Torvalds in 2005 out of a need for a replacement free distributed system for the continued development of the Linux kernel. To support the needs of the Linux kernel team, Torvalds needed a free distribution system that would patch in no more than three seconds, and protect users against accidental or malicious corruption.
