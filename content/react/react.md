[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript) library for building user interfaces or [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end) webpage components such as forms along with fields like text areas and buttons.

Since its release in 2013, React has been maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a community of developers and companies.

It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, applications are completely built with components.

Some of the most persistent issues of front-end development are solved with React, allowing one to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It is fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community thatâ€™s rapidly growing.
