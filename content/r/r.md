**R** is a popular open-source interpreted programming language used for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and version 1.0 was released in February 2000.

R supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. Additionally, custom functions and extensions provide expanded functionality. A variety of packages for R are available through the R community. They are widely used by statisticians and data scientists for tasks such as statistics, data analysis, and data visualization.

One of the most prominent IDEs for R programming is RStudio, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
