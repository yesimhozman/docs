**Swift** is a modern programming language developed by Apple. This general-purpose programming language is fast and powerful without sacrificing safety or readability. Swift is a great language to learn for those interested in iOS and macOS development, as well as anyone who is just starting to code.

Its first version was released in 2014 with the intent to create applications for iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and Linux. Since then, hundreds of companies, including Uber and Slack, have incorporated Swift into their tech stack.
