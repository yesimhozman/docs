The `RegExp` object is used for matching strings with Regular Expressions. A Regular Expression is a special string, called a pattern, that uses various character sequences to define the characteristics to match a character sequence within another string.

A `RegExp` object can also have flags set along with a pattern to change how matches are performed.

## Syntax

There are two methods of creating a `RegExp` object. The first method is literal notation using slashes to delimit the pattern, followed by any flags. The second method uses the `RegExp` constructor which takes the pattern as the first argument and any flags as the second.

```pseudo
// Using literal notation
let re1 = /foo?/i;

// Using RegExp constructor
let re2 = new RegExp('foo?', 'i');

// Both create a RegExp object with a pattern = "foo?" and a flag = "i"
```

There is a difference between the methods. Literal notation compiles when the expression is evaluated. It should be used when the pattern will remain constant, so it won't be recompiled unnecessarily, such as in a loop.

Using the object constructor means the expression will be compiled at runtime. It should be used when the pattern of the `RegExp` object would be subject to change, or the pattern is obtained during runtime, such as from user input.

### RegExp Properties

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.flags`      | Returns a string containing the flags of the `RegExp` object.                                                                    |
| `.dotAll`     | Does `.` match newlines or not?                                                                                                  |
| `.global`     | Does the `RegExp` object test against all matches in a string, or only the first?                                                |
| `.hasIndices` | Does the Regular Expression result expose the start and end indices of captured substrings?                                      |
| `.ignoreCase` | Does the `RegExp` object ignore case when performing a match?                                                                    |
| `.multiline`  | Does the `RegExp` object perform matches across multiple lines?                                                                  |
| `.source`     | The text of the pattern used by the `RegExp` object.                                                                             |
| `.sticky`     | Is the search sticky? (Does the next match have to occur at `lastIndex`, or can we match the next occurrence after `lastIndex`?) |
| `.unicode`    | Are Unicode features enabled?                                                                                                    |
| `.lastIndex`  | The index at which to start the next match.                                                                                      |

### RegExp Methods

| Method       | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `.exec(str)` | Execute a search on its `str` string parameter.  |
| `.test(str)` | Tests for a match in its `str` string parameter. |

### String Methods that Can Use RegExp Objects

In the following `re` is a `RegExp` object.

| Method                 | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.match(re)`           | Returns the array result of match(es) against the string.          |
| `.matchAll(re)`        | Returns an iterator of all the matches found within the string.\*  |
| `.replace(re, substr)` | Replaces match(es) in the string with a given substring, `substr`. |
| `.search(re)`          | Returns the index of the first match in the string.                |
| `.split(re)`           | Splits string into an array using the match(es) as a delimiter.    |

\* The RegExp object must have the `g` flag set or an exception is thrown.

### `RegExp` Flags

When specified, these flags change the default match behavor of the `RegExp` object.

| Flag | Description                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `g`  | Performs a global match, finding all matches rather than just the first. |
| `i`  | Makes matches case-insensitive. Matches both uppercase and lowercase.    |
| `m`  | Performs multiline matches. (Changes behavior of `^`,`$`)                |
| `s`  | Allows `.` to match newline characters.                                  |
| `u`  | Enables Unicode support.                                                 |
| `y`  | Matches are sticky, looking only at exact position in the text.          |

Usage:

```js
let re1 = /foo?/gim;
let re2 = new RegExp('foo?', 'gim');

// Create a RegExp object that performs a global, case-insensitive, multiline search
```

## Regular Expressions

The following characters are used to define a Regular Expression string.

### Assertions

The following match the boundaries between characters, not the characters themselves.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `^`        | Matches the beginning of input. In multiline search, matches immediately after a line break character.                                                                   |
| `$`        | Matches the end of input. In multiline search matches immediately before a line break character.                                                                         |
| `\b`       | Matches a word boundary. Point where a word character is not followed by a word character, or the point where a word character is not preceded by another word character |
| `\B`       | Matches a non-word boundary. Point where preceding and following character are of the same type.                                                                         |

The following match a character or expression based on what follows or precedes it.

| Characters | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x(?=y)`   | Match `x` only if `x` is immediately followed by `y`. `y` is not part of the match results.     |
| `x(?!y)`   | Match `x` only if `x` is not immediately followed by `y`. `y` is not part of the match results. |
| `(?<=y)x`  | Match `x` only if `x` is immediately preceded by `y`. `y` is not part of the match results.     |
| `(?<!y)x`  | Match `x` only if `x` is not immediately preceded by `y`. `y` is not part of the match results. |

#### Examples

```js
let str = 'Sally sells seashells by the seashore';

let re = /s(?=e)/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: Sally xells xeashells by the xeashore

re = /s(?!e)/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: xally sellx seaxhellx by the seaxhore

re = /^s/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: xally sells seashells by the seashore

re = /\Bs/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: Sally sellx seaxhellx by the seaxhore

By default, these quatifiers are greedy, matching as much of the string as possible. By following the quantifer with `?` (`x*?`) the match will stop at its first occurrence.

#### Examples

```js
let str = 'Billy bought a bushel of blue balloons.';

let re = /b.?l+/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: xy bought a bushel of xue xoons.

re = /[olu]{2}/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: Bixy bxght a bushel of bxe baxons.

re = /l\w*/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: Bix bought a bushex of bx bax.

re = /o\w+?/gi;
console.log(str.replace(re, 'x'));
// Output: Billy bxght a bushel x blue balxns.
