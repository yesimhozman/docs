**SwiftUI** is a [framework](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) used to build user interfaces for iOS 13+, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications. It was released by Apple in 2019.

The framework provides views, controls, and layout structures through declarative programming. This programming paradigm means that the developer declares how an application should function and appear in different states, but the actual changes in state are managed by the application itself.

## UI Build

There is a live-preview option which allows developers to visualize changes in their project's code. As the UI is built, real-time changes to the code are visible on the preview screen.

The simulator can be used, where the app is downloaded and runs on a virtual device, separate from the original machine. The app can also be downloaded to a real device for testing purposes.
