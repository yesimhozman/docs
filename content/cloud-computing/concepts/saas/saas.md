**Software as a service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing service delivery model that makes software and applications available over the Internet.

Some examples of SaaS include Google Workspace, Dropbox, and Microsoft 365.

## Architecture

SaaS services typically use a multi-tenant approach, where multiple customers share access to cloud resources. Each customer has their own space to store data. The data is isolated and will remain invisible to other tenants.

## Advantages

With its flexibility and low costs, SaaS services have several advantages including:

- **Accessibility**: Requires only an internet connection, can be accessed from an internet-enabled device (e.g., a computer, smartphone or tablet) within a location that has internet service.
- **Management**: Customers do not have to maintain anything; all maintenance and updates are provided by the service provider.
- **Scalability**: Customers can use as much of the service as they want, and are charged for the amount used.

## Challenges

Since they are not in direct control of the service, customers could face challenges such as:

- **Service Issues**: Disruptions like security breaches, server outages, or service changes are beyond the customer's control.
- **Switching Providers**: Depending on the amount of data being stored, it may be difficult to transfer the data to a different provider.
- **Updates**: If the service provider issues a new version of the product, the customer may have to allocate time learning the newer version.
