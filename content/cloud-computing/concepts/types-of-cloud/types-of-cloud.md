There are several **types of cloud** computing implementation:

## Public Cloud

Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers that deliver computing resources such as servers and storage over the Internet. Examples include the following:

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

## Private Cloud

Private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the companyâ€™s on-site data center. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud.

## Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid clouds are a combination of both private and public clouds. Data and applications are allowed to be shared between the private and public clouds. Allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds provides businesses:

- Greater flexibility.
- More deployment options.
- Optimization existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

## Multicloud

Multicloud is a combination of the above, referring to any implementation that utilizes more than one cloud solution. While it includes all hybrid clouds, multicloud also includes solutions that involve two or more public clouds, or two or more private clouds.
