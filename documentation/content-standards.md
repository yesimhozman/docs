# Content Standards

There are two types of Codecademy Docs entries:

## 1. Entry

These are regular entries that give detailed explanations of a coding concept. Think of them like short Wikipedia pages. Some of them are language-agnostic entries that fall in the "General" topic, while others are language-specific entries that fall in topics like "C", "C++", "CSS", "Emojicode", and "Python".

General (language-agnostic):

- [Comment](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/comment)
- [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/ide)
- [Array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/array)

Python (language-specific):

- [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists)
- [Conditionals](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/conditionals)
- [Dictionaries](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries)

Some of these entries, such as the Python's [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) entry, will have a terms table at the bottom with more nested term entries.

## 2. Term Entry

Term entries are like sub-entries that covers a concept's functions, methods, properties, etc. They are featured in a table of links located at the bottom of its relevant concept entry.

The Python's [Lists](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists) entry, for example, features a table of term entries including:

- [`.append()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/append) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/append/append.md))
- [`.clear()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/clear) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/clear/clear.md))
- [`.copy()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/lists/copy) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/content/python/concepts/lists/terms/copy/copy.md))

## Components of an Entry

All Codecademy Docs entries are Markdown files and should consist of three parts:

- The `file name`, with the `.md` extension.
- The metadata about the content, written in YAML, which appears at the top of the entry.
- The content, written in Markdown, with the first use of a topic, concept, or entry in **bold**.
  - Include examples with code snippets when necessary.
  - Templates for these entries can be found in the [repo documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/documentation).

We'll describe the standards for each of these components separately.

### File Name

All entry file names use the `.md` format along with the following standards:

- They must match the title of the entry. (e.g., "Three.js" -> `three-js.md`)
- It must be separated by dashes, where appropriate. (e.g., "Data Types" -> `data-types.md`)
  - If the title or name is meant to be in PascalCase: "HashTable" -> `hashtable.md`
  - If the title or name is meant to be in camelCase: ".forEach()" -> `forEach.md` (without the `.` and `()`).
- The name should always begin with a lowercase letter. (e.g., "Array" -> `array.md`, "HTML" -> `html.md`)
- Punctuation must not be included in the file name, even if it exists in the entry name. (e.g., "Moore's Law" -> `moores-law.md`, "Three.js" -> `three-js.md`, `.nextAfter()` -> `nextAfter.md`)

### Content

- All text should be written in Markdown
  - For more details on our standards for Markdown content, see Codecademy's [Curriculum Markdown Style Guide](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/content-guidelines/markdown-style-guide/).
- Each subsection should begin with a heading of size h2. (i.e., preceded by `##`)
- All in-line code should be delineated by single backticks. (`)

#### Code Blocks

Code examples are an excellent teaching tool. Many term entries will contain a code example as a standard field. Encyclopedia entries are more flexible, but if your encyclopedia entry doesn't contain any code blocks, take a moment to ask yourself if one would help!

All code blocks should be delineated by triple backticks (```).

- C: ```c
- C#: ```cs
- C++: ```cpp
- CSS: ```css
- Error: ```error
- Emojicode: ```emojic
- Golang: ```go
- HTML: ```html
- Java: ```java
- JavaScript: ```js
- Markdown: ```md
- PHP: ```php
- Plaintext: ```plaintext
- Pseudo: ```pseudo
- Python: ```py
- R: ```r
- Ruby: ```rb
- Sass: ```scss
- Scheme: ```scheme
- Shell/Program Output: ```shell
- SQL: ```sql
- Swift: ```swift

#### Codebytes: Runnable Code Blocks

Codecademy has a new feature called [Codebytes](https://www.codecademy.com/codebyte-editor) that will allow learners to click a button to run code blocks themselves! The output to the console will appear next to the code block.

Codebytes is a great tool to incorporate into some entries (for instance, if you want learners to to think about what a code block will output before they see it in action, or if you want to show a learner how a function that incorporates randomization produces different output each time).

The syntax is simple: You just add `codebyte/` between the ` ``` ` and the language name in the first line of a normal code block.

Here's an example for JavaScript:

````
## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
````

Currently, Codebytes supports the following languages:

- C++: `cpp`
- C#: `csharp`
- Go: `golang`
- JavaScript: `javascript`
- PHP: `php`
- Python: `python`
- Ruby: `ruby`

> **Note:** Codebytes sometimes requires the code block to include some boilerplate code. To check what boilerplate is required for your language, select the language from the dropdown [in this demo page](https://www.codecademy.com/codebyte-editor). There you'll find a "Hello World!" program set up as an example!

| Variable Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Title`          | The title of the entry. This will be displayed on the page at the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Title: "OOP"                                                                                        |
| `Description`    | A brief description (ideally under 150 characters) used in search engine results and content previews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Description: "A brief description of OOP"                                                           |
| `Subjects`       | Languages and technical fields that the entry relates to. We're storing all of our Subjects in the [subjects.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/subjects.md). Please only use Subjects from that list.<br /> - We aim to include an average of 1-2 subjects (and always at least 1!) with every entry.                                                                                                             | Subjects:<br /> - "Computer Science"<br /> - "Game Development"                                     |
| `Tags`           | Key words that are relevant to the entry. We're storing all of our Tags in the [tags.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/tags.md). Please only use Tags from that list, but if that list feels insufficient, feel free to create a new Tag and add it to tags.md in your PR!<br /> - We aim to include an average of 3-4 tags with every entry.                                                                     | Tags:<br /> - "React"<br /> - "URL"<br /> - "Strings"<br />                                         |
| `CatalogContent` | Slugs of Codecademy course and Path landing pages that relate to the entry. We're storing all of our slugs in the [catalog-content.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/catalog-content.md).<br /> - Please avoid linking to individual content items, because their URLs may change and some are gated by Pro membership.<br /> - We aim to include 2 slugs with every entry (1 free course and 1 Pro course/Path). | CatalogContent:<br /> - "introduction-to-javascript"<br /> - "paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" |

> **Note:** The template above does not apply to _topic_ entries. See our [topic entry template](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/blob/main/documentation/topic-info-template.md) for more details.

#### General Writing Tips

- Avoid referencing information that isn't strictly related to the topic of the entry. As a rule, you want to assume as little pre-existing knowledge as possible.
- Avoid using first- and second-person pronouns (e.g. "I", "we", "you") if possible.
- Brevity without sacrificing clarity. Make every word count and be clear and concise.
- If the concept is hard, make it easy. If it's dry, make it fun. If it's simple, keep it simple.
- 90% of writing is rewriting.
- Minimize the length of your sentences, and each one should communicate a point (paragraphs should be a maximum of 4-6 lines).
- Use white spaces, lists, and Markdown tables wherever possible to improve readability and aid comprehension.
- Always expand and explain an abbreviation the first time it is mentioned.
- Be aware of your target audience and write to their level.
- Use punctuation properly.
- Avoid using idioms as well as complex and non-contextual grammar.
- Run your content through proofreading tools (e.g. Grammarly, Prowriting Aid, Hemingway App) to check for grammar and spelling errors.
- Re-read your contents carefully, considering every line written.
- The description of your content should contain keywords for SEO purposes.

#### File Hosting

If you'd like to host files such as images, videos, or GIFs, please upload it to the [/media folder](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/media) and use the format `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/filename.ext`. That way we'll never have any broken links!

> **Note:** Some images may use `https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/` in their links. These come from existing Codecademy course content and are for internal-use only. Please disregard those and use the `media` folder and format `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/filename.ext`, instead.
